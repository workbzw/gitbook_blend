# Blend Document Hub
Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
This Portal links to the key resources on Aave to understand the fundamentals of the Protocol. Please join the discussion on Aave community Discord server; our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of Aave.
